"28251.000000000007","<center><p>The first strategy is called REAPPRAISAL. This means that you attend to the picture and try to change the meaning of it. That means you think of something to tell yourself about the picture that helps you feel less negative about it. For example, you could tell yourself something about the outcome of the picture, that whatever is going on will soon be resolved, or that help is on the way. You could also focus on a specific detail of the situation that may not be as bad as it first seemed. But we want you to stay focused on the picture and not think of random things that will make you feel better, but rather to change something about the picture that helps you to feel less negative about it. It is very important that when you reappraise you do not think that the picture is fake or a scene from a movie. Think of it as a real situation, and then change the meaning of it. <b>Once again, as soon as the picture is on the screen, keep focusing on the picture, but tell yourself something about it that makes you feel less negative; keep repeating it to yourself while the screen is up.</b></p><p>Press the spacebar to continue</p></center>","32","html-keyboard-response","2","44099","0.0-2.0","ekp69","",""

"12648","<center><p>The second strategy is called DISTRACTION. This means that you try your best to feel less negative about the picture by thinking of something that is completely unrelated to the picture. There are a few ways you can do this. First, you can think about geometric shapes. For instance, if you see a bloody knife, you can think of a big yellow triangle. Second, you can imagine yourself doing everyday tasks, such as taking a shower or making coffee in the morning. Third, you can imagine your neighborhood or other familiar streets. You could use any one of these ways to distract yourself, which you think will work best in making you feel less negative.

You could also focus on a specific detail of the situation that may not be as bad as it first seemed. But we want you to stay focused on the picture and not think of random things that will make you feel better, but rather to change something about the picture that helps you to feel less negative about it. It is very important that when you reappraise you do not think that the picture is fake or a scene from a movie. Think of it as a real situation, and then change the meaning of it. <b>Once again, as soon as the picture is on the screen, keep focusing on the picture, but tell yourself something about it that makes you feel less negative; keep repeating it to yourself while the screen is up.</b></p><p>Press the spacebar to continue</p></center>","32","html-keyboard-response","2","58920","0.0-2.0","ssrzw","",""

Second, you can imagine yourself doing everyday tasks, such as taking a shower or making coffee in the morning. Third, you can imagine your neighborhood or other familiar streets.

Think of it as a real situation, and then change the meaning of it. <b>Once again, as soon as the picture is on the screen, keep focusing on the picture, but tell yourself something about it that makes you feel less negative; keep repeating it to yourself while the screen is up.</b></p><p>Press the spacebar to continue</p></center>","32","html-keyboard-response","2","71036","0.0-2.0","2ahf1","",""
